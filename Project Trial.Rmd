# The following data set is an example data set to establish some basic skills within RMarkdown. The goal for this is basic exercise to calculate the mean for a given column, ignoring the unknown (NA) values. This was a helpful website: https://www.statology.org/r-mean-of-column/
> df <- data.frame(drug1 = c(4,5,6, NA), drug2 = c(6,7,8, NA), drug3 = c(8, 9, 10, NA))
> mean(df$drug1, na.rm=TRUE)

# The goal for the project as a whole is to analyze Shea's capstone data, which is data collected from white tailed deer in Oklahoma.
# The data will be entered from an excel file that has been created and analyzed using a T-test to measure the P-value and the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium to measure allele frequency. Averages of each numberic value column will also be established.
# The following is an upload of the excel data sheet file that we are using. This was a helpful website: https://community.rstudio.com/t/load-excel-file-into-rmarkdown/103020/3
